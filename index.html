        <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
          <li>
            Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
          </li>
        </ul>

        Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
        salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
        water or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick
        frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette:
        Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
        to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional):
        When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in
        the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one
        edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then
        slide it onto a plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper
        if needed. Nutrition The table below shows nutritional values per
