# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page 

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm).

My challenge was to build out a <strong>recipe page</strong> and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge.
